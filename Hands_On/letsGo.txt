*SQL (Structured query language) or SQUEL(Structured English query language) is the language we use to work with Relational Database Management system.
There are many relational database management system like ~ MYSQL, SQL Server, Oracle. ( My SQL is the most popular open source database in the world )

2> Non - relational / NoSQL database
